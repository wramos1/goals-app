# Goal Setter

This project was developed utilizing the MERN stack and a created REST endpoint. Constructed as a full-stack application with user authentication, it allows users to register and create goals that will be saved into a database. When users log back in, their created goals will still be automatically rendered into the UI.
If a user decides that a goal no longer fits their schedule, they can simply delete it and it will be removed from their data. 

Since this app was deployed on Heroku, the page may take a few more seconds to load.

_Technologies Used: React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Node, Express, MongoDB(Mongoose)_
